# ProfessionalBillingApplication
This is an application that should be able to be used for companies that would like to keep track of customers, etc.

I began working on this application about two months ago, and I took a bit of a break. I would like to get back into it, but I would like to make it an open-source project.

This application should be able to keep track of customer's, their billing information for the company, etc.

I have been programming this application in Java, and I am using H2 Embedded databases for the storage of the information. Any ideas and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
